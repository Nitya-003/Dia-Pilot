# Dia-Pilot 
### Proactive AI-Powered Diabetes Management Platform

Dia-Pilot is a proactive, AI-driven diabetes management ecosystem built to shift healthcare from reactive monitoring to predictive guidance. The backend is a high-performance **Python** implementation hosted on **Microsoft Azure**, ensuring scalability, security, and clinical reliability.

## System Architecture

Our cloud-native architecture leverages Python-based Azure Functions to orchestrate AI services and patient data in real-time.

## The Problem & Solution
* **The Problem:** Diabetes care is currently reactive and fragmented. Patients experience "alert fatigue" from reactive alarms, and manual logging leads to burnout.
* **The Solution:** Dia-Pilot predicts glucose risks before they occur, automates data collection via AI Vision and Speech, and delivers decision-ready insights to clinicians.

---

## Key Features
* **Predictive Intelligence:** Glycemic forecasting and early hypoglycemia detection.
* **Frictionless Input:** Food photo logging and voice-based health updates.
* **Clinician Enablement:** One-page executive health summaries and risk-based triaging.
* **Behavioral Intelligence:** Context-aware nudges and metabolic peer matching.
